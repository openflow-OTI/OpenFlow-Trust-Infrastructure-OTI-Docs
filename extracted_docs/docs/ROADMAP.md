# OTI — Product Roadmap
> Last updated: July 10, 2026 (session 8 — full rewrite for consistency with the new `FIXES.md` file; no strategic changes, phase structure unchanged from the July 5 reorganization) | Maintained by: Development Manager
> Source document: OTI Full Distribution & Technical Development Strategy (Founder's Playbook, July 2026)

## The Core Thesis (from the Playbook)
> "OTI is not a wallet checker website. It is on-chain behavioral intelligence as a service — the infrastructure layer for trust in Web3. The website is the demo. The API is the product."

**Who buys this:**
- 🏦 Exchanges & Gateways — screen withdrawal destinations, detect compromised wallets (enterprise sale, highest value)
- ⚡ DeFi Protocols — risk-adjust lending/collateral based on wallet trust (API integration)
- 🖼️ NFT Marketplaces — seller trust badges, filter bad actors (API integration)
- 💸 Payment Processors — gate crypto payments behind minimum trust score (API integration)

**Three goals (from Playbook):**
- 🎯 90 days after distribution launches: 1,000 active API users via bots + widget
- 🏗️ 6 months: 3 paying business API integrations
- 🏦 12 months: first enterprise exchange contract

## MVP Definition

**MVP = the core product is secure, correct, and presentable to potential partners.**

MVP is complete when:
1. ✅ 15 chains scoring correctly (non-EVM accuracy audit still in progress — see `FIXES.md` BF10)
2. ✅ API key + quota system working
3. ✅ Score sharing (PNG card) working
4. ✅ Admin endpoints secured
5. ✅ Score history served from database, not memory
6. ✅ Signal scores return weighted values in API response
7. ✅ Signal bars display weighted contributions on frontend
8. ✅ Results page redesigned to professional standard

MVP's core build is complete. What remains before it's fully trustworthy for distribution is correctness work — tracked as fixes, not roadmap items. See `FIXES.md`.

---

## ✅ Completed Foundation Work

The original scoring engine, API key system, score sharing, security hardening, and full frontend redesign (results page + homepage, black/mint visual system) are all live in production. Every bug found and fixed along the way — from the admin auth gap to Bitcoin's wallet-age bug to the anonymous-limit cache sync issue — is logged in `FIXES.md`, not here. This roadmap only tracks what's still ahead to build.

---

## PHASE 1 — PRE-DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS
**Owner: Both Builders | Status: ✅ Core pages done — one operational item and one open fix remain (see below)**

These are prerequisites. Every bot reply, widget badge, and extension popup links back to OTI. Without a front door and a docs page, that traffic converts to nothing.

### 1A — Marketing Homepage ✅ DONE
Live at `otiscore.vercel.app`. The scoring tool moved to `/score`; `/` is now a professional marketing page (Hero, How It Works, Trust Signals, Use Cases, Get the API, Find Us/Integrations, footer) sharing the same Vercel project and brand system as the scoring app.

### 1B — Developer Docs Site ✅ DONE
Docusaurus site, live at `otiscore.vercel.app/docs/` (proxied from a standalone `oti-docs` Vercel project). Covers Getting Started, API Reference (weighted signal shape), Score Explanation, Supported Chains, Rate Limits, and code examples in JS/Python/cURL.

### 1C — Whitepaper ✅ DONE
Live at `/whitepaper`, sharing the homepage's nav/footer and brand system.

### 1D — Operational Keys (Ahmad, not a Builder) — OPEN
- Create internal bot API key via admin panel (high daily limit, not the anonymous key)
- Create widget shared key with a `widget` plan tier
- CORS is already open globally — no changes needed

### Still open before this phase fully closes
- `FIXES.md` BF10 — non-EVM signal accuracy (critical, in progress with Backend Builder)
- `FIXES.md` BF11 — re-verify "Try It Live" docs widget hits the real Railway backend
- `FIXES.md` FF17 — "AI-native tell" cleanup across homepage/docs/whitepaper (open, high priority)

---

## PHASE 2 — WALLET OWNERSHIP REGISTRY (WOR)
**Owner: Backend Builder + Frontend Builder | Status: Not started — does NOT depend on Phase 1 closing, can run in parallel**

Ahmad's flagship trust feature. Users pre-register wallet ownership via off-chain EIP-191 signing + passkey. If a wallet is compromised, the owner connects the wallet + enters the passkey → instant 0-score flag. No admin review. No blockchain. Fully automated.

Even if the attacker has the private keys, they don't have the pre-registered passkey. This is the differentiator.

**What needs to be built:**
| Component | Owner |
|---|---|
| `wallet_ownership` DB table | Backend |
| `POST /api/wallet/register` | Backend |
| `POST /api/report/compromised` | Backend |
| EIP-191 signature verification | Backend |
| Registration UI (wallet connect + sign + passkey) | Frontend |
| Report UI (wallet connect + passkey + submit) | Frontend |
| `wallet_links` routes (links existing table to WOR) | Backend |

---

## PHASE 3 — MONETIZATION INFRASTRUCTURE
**Owner: Both Builders | Status: Planned — infrastructure partially ready**

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| Developer self-serve portal | Sign up, get API key, choose plan — no Ahmad needed |
| Pro/Enterprise plan tiers | `plan_configs` table ready, needs new rows + payment checkout |
| Fiat payments | Stripe — easiest integration, industry standard |
| Crypto payments | Coinbase Commerce (hosted checkout, low setup) |
| BSC/Base/Optimism unlock | $49/mo Etherscan Lite — Ahmad's decision |
| **OTI token + presale** | Finalized design — see `TOKENOMICS.md`. Own independent token (not the OpenFlow "FLOW" ecosystem token), 30,000,000 fixed supply, launching on BSC first, cross-chain later. Price/liquidity design intentionally deferred — do not reconstruct. Not yet scoped into Builder tasks. |

---

## PHASE 4 — GROWTH FEATURES
**Status: Future**

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| Score history UI | DB already accumulating data |
| Multi-chain wallet comparison | Same wallet scored across multiple chains |
| Wallet portfolio view | `wallet_links` table infrastructure already built |
| Webhook alerts | Notify integrators when a watched wallet is compromised |
| Enterprise exchange path | Compliance screening, withdrawal risk scoring — see Playbook Section 16 |

---

## PHASE 5 — DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS (bots, widget, extension) 🔒 GATED — LAST PHASE
**Owner: Backend Builder (bots + widget) + separate repo (extension) | Status: Not started — begins only after Phase 1 fully closes**

This is the only phase gated behind Phase 1 (marketing homepage, docs site, operational keys). Every bot reply, widget badge, and extension popup links back to those pages — launching before they exist wastes the traffic. Everything else (WOR, monetization, growth) ships first; distribution channels are the final step before public launch.

### Channel 1 — Telegram Bot
- Library: Telegraf (Node.js) — free
- Lives in: `/bots/telegram/` inside backend repo
- Railway deployment: second process alongside API server
- Commands: `/score [address] [chain]`, `/help`, `/about`
- Group mode = viral lever: bot added to a crypto group, replies are public
- **Railway free tier warning:** API + Telegram + Discord = ~720 hours/month. May need Railway Hobby ($5/mo).
- Env vars needed: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `OTI_BOT_API_KEY`

### Channel 2 — Discord Bot
- Library: discord.js (Node.js) — free
- Lives in: `/bots/discord/` inside backend repo
- Railway deployment: third process
- Slash commands: `/score`, `/help`
- Rich embed responses (color, fields, thumbnail)
- Env vars needed: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `OTI_BOT_API_KEY`

### Channel 3 — Embeddable Widget
- Vanilla JS, zero dependencies, served from Railway at `GET /widget.js`
- One-line integration for site owners: `<div data-oti-wallet="0x..." data-oti-chain="ethereum"></div><script src="...widget.js" async></script>`
- Uses shared widget API key internally
- Target sites: NFT marketplaces, on-chain portfolio trackers, P2P OTC platforms

### Channel 4 — Firefox Extension (then Chrome)
- Separate GitHub repo: `oti-firefox-extension`
- Content script: auto-detects `0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}` addresses on Etherscan, OpenSea, BscScan
- Injects score badge next to each address
- Firefox first (free to publish) → Chrome after first revenue ($5 one-time fee)
- No backend changes required

**Distribution funnel:**
```
Community user sees bot reply → Shares score card (OTI branding)
→ Developer discovers OTI → Visits dev docs → Gets free API key → Integrates
→ Business sees API usage → Reaches out for enterprise contract
```
