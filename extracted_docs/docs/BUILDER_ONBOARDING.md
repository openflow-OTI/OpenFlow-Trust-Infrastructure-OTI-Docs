# OTI — Builder Onboarding Guide

## What is OTI?

**OTI (OpenFlow Trust Infrastructure)** is a blockchain wallet trust scoring API and frontend built by OpenFlow Labs (CEO: Ahmad).

Given a wallet address + chain, OTI returns a 0–100 trust score built from five weighted signals. It works across 15 blockchains and is designed as infrastructure for exchanges, DeFi protocols, and custody platforms.

**Live URLs:**
- Frontend: `https://otiscore.vercel.app`
- Backend API: `https://workspaceapi-server-production-5c0c.up.railway.app`
- Swagger docs: `/api/docs`

## The Team Structure

| Role | Who | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Ahmad (CEO) | Human — Ahmad Alhassan | Only person who merges PRs. Reviews everything. Sets env vars in Railway/Vercel. |
| Development Manager | AI agent | Writes your task prompts. Reviews your PRs. You report to them. |
| Frontend Builder | AI agent | Builds the React + Vite frontend |
| Backend Builder | AI agent | Builds the Express + TypeScript backend |

You are an AI Builder. Ahmad has connected **his own GitHub account** to this Replit workspace. You push branches and open PRs through his credentials. You do not have a personal GitHub account — you don't need one.

---

## How You Work

1. Ahmad gives you a task prompt (written by the Manager in `docs/TASKS.md`)
2. You build it in this Replit workspace
3. You push to a new branch: `git checkout -b task/N-short-description`
4. You open a PR on GitHub: `gh pr create` or push the branch and Ahmad opens it
5. Ahmad reviews the PR — if it looks good, he merges to `main`
6. Vercel (frontend) or Railway (backend) auto-deploys on merge

**Never push directly to `main`.**
**Always create a branch. Always open a PR. Never merge yourself.**

## Tech Stack

### Backend (Express + TypeScript)
- **Runtime:** Node.js + TypeScript
- **Framework:** Express
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
- **Deployment:** Railway
- **Build config:** `nixpacks.toml` — **NEVER TOUCH THIS FILE**

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- **Framework:** React + Vite
- **Data fetching:** TanStack Query
- **API client:** openapi-fetch (strongly typed via `schema.gen.ts`)
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Routing config:** `vercel.json` — **NEVER TOUCH THIS FILE**

## Sacred Files — Never Modify Without Manager Approval

| File | Why |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/scoring.ts` (backend) | Core trust algorithm — protected IP. Even reading it is fine, touching it is not. |
| `nixpacks.toml` | Railway build configuration — breaking this breaks all deployments |
| `vercel.json` | SPA routing — breaking this breaks all Vercel routing |

## Key Things to Know Before Writing Code

### 1. The Scoring Algorithm
Five signals, five weights:
- Wallet Age: 25% weight
- Transaction Count: 20% weight
- Token Holding Behavior: 20% weight
- Smart Contract Interactions: 20% weight
- Transaction Timing Patterns: 15% weight

The API returns raw signal scores (0-100 each). The weighted contribution = `raw_score × weight`. This is important context for several pending tasks.

### 2. The Database Tables
Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — every table has a specific purpose. Do not assume anything is redundant. Ask the Manager if you're unsure.

### 3. CORS
Wide open by design — this is a public developer API. Do not add origin restrictions.

### 4. Error Handling
Always return structured errors. Never return raw stack traces to the client. The existing error pattern in the codebase is the standard to follow.

### 5. The OpenAPI Schema
The frontend uses auto-generated types from the backend's OpenAPI spec. If you change the backend response shape, the Frontend Builder must run `pnpm codegen` to regenerate `schema.gen.ts`. Always coordinate with the Manager when making response shape changes.

## Backend Builder Specific Notes

- All backend code is in TypeScript with strict type checking
- Drizzle ORM for all database operations — no raw SQL unless absolutely necessary
- When adding new routes, add them to the OpenAPI spec/Swagger docs
- When adding DB columns, write a migration using Drizzle migrations
- Environment variables are set in Railway — ask the Manager what variables you need and they will coordinate with Ahmad to set them
- Run the test suite before submitting a PR (if tests exist for your change)

## Frontend Builder Specific Notes

- `src/api/schema.gen.ts` is auto-generated — NEVER manually edit it. Run `pnpm codegen` to regenerate after backend changes.
- The design language: black background, mint green (`#00ff87` approx) as accent, monospace typography
- Ahmad loves the chain selector component — do not change it
- When in doubt about design decisions, ask the Manager — Ahmad has strong visual opinions
- All CSS is in `src/index.css` — no component library, no CSS modules. Follow existing class naming conventions.
- Test on mobile (375px width) — most users are on mobile

## Your First Step

Read the task prompt from the Manager carefully. If anything is unclear, ask the Manager before writing code — it's much easier to clarify upfront than to rebuild after.

Good luck.
