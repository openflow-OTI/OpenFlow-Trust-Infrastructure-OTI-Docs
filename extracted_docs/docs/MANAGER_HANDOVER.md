# OTI — Manager Handover Document
> Last updated: July 11, 2026 (session 9 — full architectural discussion with Ahmad before sending BF10. Key decisions made: (1) Bitcoin weight redistribution confirmed — Token Holding and Smart Contract Interactions display as honest 0, their combined 40% weight redistributed proportionally to the 3 remaining signals (Wallet Age 41.7%, Tx Count 33.3%, Timing 25%), Bitcoin only. (2) DB-backed score cache confirmed — DB becomes the primary cache source, 30-day validity, admin panel controls rescore period on a rolling daily basis, highest score kept in sync (BF13). (3) No API versioning needed — no existing subscribers, fix in place. (4) Four new fixes added to FIXES.md: BF13 (DB cache), BF14 (dead recordHistory write), BF15 (compromised wallet check on cache hits), BF16 (chain routing registry). BF10 prompt finalised and sent to Backend Builder. Frontend Builder still idle awaiting FF17 priority call.)
> **If you are a new Manager reading this: start here. Then read ARCHITECTURE.md, ROADMAP.md, TASKS.md, and FIXES.md in that order.**
> **⚠️ Read `TOKENOMICS.md` before touching anything token-related — price/liquidity sections were deliberately removed at Ahmad's request. Do not add them back or estimate them yourself.**

## ⚠️ Important — Where the Code Lives

This Replit workspace is the **Manager's workspace** — used for documentation, prompt writing, and roadmap management only. It does NOT contain OTI source code.

The actual OTI source code lives in Ahmad's GitHub repositories:
- **Backend repo:** https://github.com/openflow-OTI/OpenFlow-Trust-Infrastructure-OTI- — **PRIVATE**
- **Frontend repo:** https://github.com/openflow-OTI/OpenFlow-Trust-Infrastructure-O-T-I-Frontend- — **PUBLIC**
- **Docs repo:** https://github.com/openflow-OTI/OpenFlow-Trust-Infrastructure-OTI-Docs — **Manager's workspace repo**

## About Ahmad

Ahmad is CEO of OpenFlow Labs and sole GitHub merge authority. He does NOT want the Manager to touch code or push to GitHub. The Manager writes task prompts for Builders, reviews PRs with GO/NO-GO decisions, and owns the product roadmap and documentation.

- Call him Ahmad (not "sir", not "boss")
- He is not a software engineer — explain things clearly but don't be condescending
- He has strong product vision — trust it, build around it
- He uses the Replit multi-account system (see bottom of this file)
- He works primarily from his phone
- One task at a time per Builder — Ahmad's explicit, non-negotiable preference
- Every reply to Ahmad must be in a copy box so he can paste it to Builders
- Bug fixes / cleanup / polish are NOT tasks — they go in `FIXES.md`, never folded into an existing task or listed as a numbered Task. This was an explicit correction from Ahmad on July 10, 2026 after the Manager had previously folded a fix into an existing task's number.

## The Team

| Role | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ahmad (CEO) | Always active | Sole GitHub merge authority |
| Frontend Builder | Active, idle | All build tasks (8, 8B, 9, 11A, 11B, 11) done and verified live. Awaiting Ahmad's priority call on `FIXES.md` FF17 (AI-native tell cleanup) before receiving a new item. |
| Backend Builder | Active | Mid-way through `FIXES.md` BF10 (Signal Accuracy Audit) — sent July 8, 2026, in progress, not yet reviewed. Nothing new goes to them until it's verified done. |
| Development Manager | This account | Writes prompts, reviews PRs, owns roadmap and docs |

## Current State of Production

**Live and working:**
- Backend on Railway: `https://workspaceapi-server-production-5c0c.up.railway.app`
- Frontend on Vercel: `https://otiscore.vercel.app` (marketing homepage at `/`, scoring tool at `/score`, whitepaper at `/whitepaper`, admin panel at `/admin`)
- Developer docs live at `https://otiscore.vercel.app/docs/` (standalone deployment: `https://oti-docs.vercel.app/`)
- 15 chains scoring (10 EVM + TON, Solana, Sui, Bitcoin, Tron; BSC/Base/Optimism intentionally return 503 pending Ahmad's Etherscan Lite decision)
- API key + daily quota system (dynamic, DB-driven, enforced with real 429s)
- Score caching, compromised-wallet denylist with red banner UI
- Admin Panel fully working — Dashboard, API Keys (create/list/edit/delete + reveal-once modal), Query History, Cache, Plan Configs
- Full black/mint visual redesign live across scoring app, homepage, and whitepaper (see the locked color system in `FRONTEND_TASKS.md`)

**What's still open before Phase 1 (pre-distribution) fully closes** — full detail in `FIXES.md`:
- BF10 — non-EVM signal accuracy audit (CRITICAL, in progress with Backend Builder)
- BF11 — re-verify "Try It Live" docs widget hits the real Railway backend
- FF17 — AI-native tell cleanup across homepage/docs/whitepaper (open, high priority, not yet sent — needs Ahmad's priority confirmation)

**ADMIN_SECRET status:** Ahmad set `ADMIN_SECRET` in Railway Variables. Admin Panel login at `otiscore.vercel.app/admin` confirmed working.

**⚠️ OTI COLOR SYSTEM — LOCKED July 7, 2026.** Full token table lives in `FRONTEND_TASKS.md`. Do not revert to pure black `#000000`.

**Critical infrastructure note — Railway `subscriptions` table real schema:** the Drizzle schema in the repo does NOT match Railway's actual DB. Real columns: `id, api_key, plan, owner_address, created_at, expires_at, updated_at`. **NO `status` column, NO `email` column.** All backend handlers use raw SQL on this table — never use Drizzle ORM selects here, they crash with "column does not exist." (Full history of this bug and its fixes: `FIXES.md` BF4/BF9.)

---

## What Changed This Session (Documentation Reorganization)

Ahmad's directive: bug fixes/cleanup/polish are not tasks. Create `FIXES.md`, move every fix-type item there out of `TASKS.md`/`BACKEND_TASKS.md`/`FRONTEND_TASKS.md`, number small fixes first, split by Builder. Then rewrite everything fresh rather than edit incrementally.

**What now lives where:**
- `TASKS.md`, `BACKEND_TASKS.md`, `FRONTEND_TASKS.md` — only genuine new-build tasks (new pages, new systems, new features)
- `FIXES.md` — every bug fix, correctness fix, security fix, hardening pass, and polish/cleanup item, split into a Backend list and a Frontend list, each numbered smallest/quickest first
- `ROADMAP.md` — unchanged in structure, updated only to reference `FIXES.md` where relevant
- `READING_GUIDE.md` — added a row/section for `FIXES.md`
- `PENDING_BACKEND_PROMPT.md` — deleted. It was a stale, superseded draft for what became Task 11C/BF10 (already correctly sent and in progress under the right identity)

**Fix vs. task rule going forward:** a task builds something that didn't exist before; a fix repairs, corrects, hardens, or polishes something that already exists. When in doubt, ask: "if this were never done, would the product be missing a capability (task) or just imperfect (fix)?"

**The former Task 11C (Signal Accuracy Audit) is now `FIXES.md` BF10** — it corrects existing scoring behavior for non-EVM chains rather than building a new feature. Its status, priority, and "in progress" state are unchanged — only its home file changed. The former Task 11E (AI-native tell audit) is now `FIXES.md` FF17, same situation.

## Active Decisions — Do Not Reverse Without Ahmad's Approval

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| `scoring.ts` is SACRED — never modify | Core IP, protected algorithm |
| `nixpacks.toml` is SACRED — never touch | Railway build config |
| `vercel.json` is SACRED — never touch (one narrow exception already used for the docs proxy rewrite) | SPA routing |
| CORS is fully open | Intentional — OTI is a public developer API |
| BSC/Base/Optimism are 503 | Waiting for Etherscan Lite decision |
| Admin page is URL-only (no nav link) | Ahmad's decision |
| WOR reports are automated (no admin review) | Ahmad's decision |
| One task at a time per Builder | Ahmad's explicit, hard preference |
| All Manager replies to Ahmad in copy boxes | Ahmad's preference — he pastes them to Builders |
| Fixes are never folded into tasks or given task numbers — they live in `FIXES.md` | Ahmad's explicit correction, July 10, 2026 |
| Price/liquidity design intentionally absent from `TOKENOMICS.md` | Deferred by Ahmad, decide later, do not reconstruct |

## Next Things the Manager Must Do (In Order)

### 1. Check in with Backend Builder on `FIXES.md` BF10
Signal Accuracy Audit — sent July 8, 2026, in progress, not yet reviewed. This is the single most important open item; nothing else goes to Backend Builder until it's verified done. Definition of done is in `FIXES.md` BF10.

### 2. Get Ahmad's priority call on `FIXES.md` FF17
AI-native tell cleanup across homepage, docs, and whitepaper — scoped, not yet sent. Confirm with Ahmad whether this should go to Frontend Builder now or wait, and whether it should be split into three smaller passes (homepage / docs / whitepaper) rather than one large one.

### 3. Once BF10 and FF17 are clear, move to Phase 5 gate check
Phase 1 (pre-distribution requirements) is otherwise fully built. Once BF10, BF11, and FF17 are all resolved, confirm with Ahmad that Phase 1 is closed before starting any Phase 5 (distribution channel) task — Tasks 12–15 in `TASKS.md`.

### Lesson learned (scope creep during Task 11 — historical, resolved)
Ahmad personally authorized a previous Frontend Builder to keep working past the original Task 11 spec, leading to 8 self-directed rounds and some unplanned production breakage (docs 404, "Try It Live" pointed at a non-existent custom domain). Some of the extra work was valuable (a privacy audit caught a real leak), but it shipped without a mid-task check-in. Fully remediated; Task 11 is now live. Going forward: even with a blanket go-ahead, a Builder should check in with the Manager before migrating live API URLs or touching deployment config — those changes have production blast radius beyond the original task.

### Lesson learned (Vercel/Docusaurus docs proxy debugging)
Full detail in the Manager's persistent memory (`vercel-docs-proxy.md` topic). Summary: (1) Vercel rewrites treat `/docs` and `/docs/` as distinct routes — a wildcard `/docs/:path*` rule does not cover the bare trailing-slash case, always test all three forms via curl; (2) Docusaurus's `baseUrl` only changes link prefixes/router basename, not the physical build output folder structure — check the actual local `build/` folder before assuming a hosting platform's directory settings are misconfigured.

### Lesson learned (verifying "done" reports)
A live-site check of Task 11A initially looked broken (`/` showed the old scoring form) — turned out to be a stale/cached screenshot, not a real bug. A cache-busted check (`?t=<random>` + checking `x-vercel-cache`/`age` headers) confirmed it was genuinely live and correct. Always re-verify with a cache-busted check before reporting a problem to Ahmad — false alarms cost trust too.

## The Replit Multi-Account System

Ahmad uses multiple Replit free-tier accounts to avoid hitting credit limits:
- **Manager account** — writes prompts, manages roadmap and docs
- **Frontend Builder account** — builds frontend, notifies Manager when work is done
- **Backend Builder account** — builds backend, notifies Manager when work is done

When credits exhaust → Ahmad pushes to GitHub via Replit's Git interface → opens new account → handover → continue.

**All context lives in the GitHub repository, not in AI chat memory:**
- `docs/MANAGER_HANDOVER.md` — this file
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — what every piece of the codebase is
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — all planned features with status
- `docs/TASKS.md` — master list of genuine new-build tasks
- `docs/FIXES.md` — master list of bug fixes, corrections, hardening, and cleanup, split by Builder
- `docs/BACKEND_TASKS.md` / `docs/FRONTEND_TASKS.md` — each Builder's dedicated task file
- `docs/BUILDER_ONBOARDING.md` — onboarding for each Builder role
- `docs/READING_GUIDE.md` — who reads which file and when

---

## How Builders Get These Docs

Builders do not receive docs via email or file download. The **OTI docs zip file** lives inside the GitHub repos. When a Builder clones the repo, they extract the zip to get all doc files.

**What Ahmad tells each Builder on day one:**
> "Clone the repo. Find the OTI docs zip file in the project root and extract it. Read BUILDER_ONBOARDING.md first, then ARCHITECTURE.md, then open your dedicated task file — and check FIXES.md for anything assigned to you there too."

**GitHub visibility:**
- **Frontend repo → PUBLIC** — React code has no secrets
- **Backend repo → PRIVATE** — scoring algorithm IP, admin routes, API key logic

## New Manager Startup Procedure

1. Read `docs/MANAGER_HANDOVER.md` (this file) — full picture
2. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system structure
3. Read `docs/ROADMAP.md` — strategic context
4. Read `docs/TASKS.md` — every genuine build task, current queue
5. Read `docs/FIXES.md` — every open/in-progress fix, per Builder
6. Jump straight to "Next Things the Manager Must Do" above and start from step 1

**Rule before ending ANY Manager session:**
1. If a task or fix was confirmed done: tell the Builder to mark it ✅ in THEIR OWN copy of the relevant file AND their own `TASKS.md`/`FIXES.md` — the Manager's copy is physically separate from each Builder's copy (different account, different repo checkout). Updating the Manager's copy never updates a Builder's copy. Send this instruction explicitly, every time.
2. If a new task or fix was added: add it to `TASKS.md` or `FIXES.md` first, then tell the Builder to add it to their own file too (same separate-copies caveat).
3. Builders never update files on their own initiative — only when the Manager explicitly instructs.
4. Update "Current State of Production" and "Next Things" in this file before closing.
5. Ahmad pushes everything via Replit's Git interface.
6. One task at a time per Builder — Ahmad's hard rule, never break it.
7. Fixes never get folded into tasks or given task numbers — they go in `FIXES.md`.

## ⚠️ Critical Infrastructure Note — Railway Migrations Do NOT Auto-Run

Confirmed July 5, 2026: Railway's deploy pipeline only runs `pnpm install && build && start`. It does **NOT** run `drizzle-kit push`. Every future schema change needs Ahmad to manually run `drizzle-kit push` against the Railway production `DATABASE_URL` after deploying. Optional one-line fix tracked as `FIXES.md` BF12 (add `drizzle-kit push` to `railway.json`'s `buildCommand` — not `nixpacks.toml`, which stays sacred).

---

## Critical Context That Must Never Be Lost

1. **Wallet Ownership Registry (WOR)** is Ahmad's flagship feature — off-chain signing + passkey pre-registration, no blockchain, no admin review, fully automated. See `ROADMAP.md` Phase 2.
2. **`wallet_links` table** was built in anticipation of WOR + portfolio features. Not abandoned — needs WOR to exist first.
3. **`scores` table** is a lightweight fast-lookup cache alongside the full `chain_scores` historical table. Not redundant — serves a different read pattern.
4. **The 3 unavailable chains** (BSC, Base, Optimism) return 503 intentionally, pending Ahmad's Etherscan Lite ($49/mo) decision.
5. **Task numbering:** Task 12 = Telegram Bot, 13 = Discord Bot, 14 = Widget, 15 = Firefox Extension (all Phase 5). The former "Task 11C" and "Task 11E" are now `FIXES.md` BF10 and FF17 respectively — they are fixes, not numbered tasks, and this renumbering-out-of-TASKS.md is intentional, not a mistake to undo.
6. **Non-EVM signal accuracy is a known critical bug** (`FIXES.md` BF10) — every non-EVM wallet is currently scored with EVM-specific logic. Must be fixed before any distribution channel launches.
7. **`PATCH /api/admin/plan-configs/:id`** accepts both a UUID and a plan-name string (e.g. "anonymous") — dual lookup, both work correctly.
8. **`useAnonymousLimit` hook** calls the public `GET /api/config/anonymous-limit` endpoint (no auth). Falls back to displaying 3 only on a genuine fetch failure; a real `null` from the server means "Unlimited," and is displayed as such. Invalidates on every Plan Configs save so the homepage updates immediately.
