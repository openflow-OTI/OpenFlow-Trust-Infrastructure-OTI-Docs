# OTI — Master Task Queue
> Last updated: July 6, 2026 (updated by Manager) | Maintained by: Development Manager
> **Manager:** This is your master record — add all new tasks here first, then instruct Builders.
> **Builders:** You also update this file — but only when the Manager explicitly tells you to (marking a task done or adding a new task). Never update it on your own initiative.
> Never let this file go stale.

---

## How to Read This File

- **TASKS.md = the Manager's master record** (all tasks, all roles, all phases — complete picture)
- **BACKEND_TASKS.md / FRONTEND_TASKS.md** = what each Builder actually reads and works from
- **ROADMAP.md = the strategic context** (why we're building it, the phases, the goals)
- When something is done: Manager confirms with the Builder → Manager explicitly tells Builder to mark it done → Builder marks it ✅ here AND in their own task file
- When a new task is added: Manager adds it here → Manager explicitly tells Builder to add it to their file → Builder adds it to their own file AND to this file

---

## Builder Roles

| Role | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend Builder | Active | Tasks 1, 2, 2B done — Task 7 up next |
| Backend Builder | Active | Tasks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7D done — queue empty, standing by |

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Task 1 — Frontend UI Polish ✅
- Homepage title, back button style, chain icon sizing, dead CSS removed, `isKnownChain()` guard in `useScore.ts`

### Task 2 — Logo Fix ✅
- `Logo.tsx` → `<img src="/logo.jpg">` replacing spiral SVG math
- `generateScoreCard.ts` → uses `loadImage()` before canvas draw

### Task 3 — Admin Route Authentication ✅
- `adminAuth.ts` middleware applied to all `/api/admin/*` routes
- Returns 401 on missing/wrong `x-admin-secret` header
- Swagger updated; verified live on Railway

### Task 4 — History Endpoint → Database ✅
- `GET /api/score/:address/history` now queries `chain_scores` DB table
- Optional `?chain=` filter with auto-detection; ordered by `scored_at` DESC, limited to 50
- OpenAPI spec updated; verified live on Railway

### Task 5 — Signal Scores → Weighted API Response ✅
- `signalWeighting.ts` transformer added (scoring.ts untouched)
- Score response now returns `{ score, weighted, maxWeight }` per signal
- Both OpenAPI specs updated (served + frontend codegen); verified live on Railway

### Task 2B — Logo: SVG Replace ✅
- Original SVG logo file used directly as `public/logo.svg` — no reconstruction needed
- Crisp at 34px on Retcel/high-DPI screens, zero blur
- `generateScoreCard.ts` already pointed to `/logo.svg`

### Task 7D — Bitcoin Wallet Age Fix ✅
- Pagination bug fixed in `bitcoin.ts` — `getBitcoinTxs()` now paginates backwards through mempool.space history
- Safety cap of 40 pages added to bound latency for hyperactive wallets
- Verified on Railway: old wallets returning walletAgedays 4,896 and 5,002 (previously returning ~5)

### Task 6 — subscriptions updatedAt Migration ✅
- `updated_at` column added to `subscriptions` table via Drizzle migration
- `PATCH /api/admin/keys/:id` now sets `updated_at: new Date()` on every update
- Railway production DB migration run manually via Railway Console on July 6, 2026
- `GET /api/admin/keys` verified returning 401 (auth working) — no longer 500

### TASK 7 — Frontend: Signal Bars → Weighted Display
**Owner:** Frontend Builder
**Phase:** 1 — Bug Fixes
**Priority:** HIGH
**Depends on:** Task 5 (backend weighted response) must be merged and deployed to Railway first

**Full prompt for Frontend Builder:**
> Run `pnpm codegen` first to regenerate `src/api/schema.gen.ts` from the updated backend OpenAPI spec (the signal shape has changed).
>
> Update the signal bar component in the results page (`src/pages/Home.tsx` or wherever the signal bars are rendered):
> - Bar fill width = `(weighted / maxWeight) × 100%` — not `score / 100`
> - Score label displayed on the right = `weighted/maxWeight` formatted as a number, e.g. "25/25", "4/20", "10.5/15" (round to 1 decimal)
> - The color logic (green/red/amber) should be based on `weighted / maxWeight` ratio, same threshold as before

**Definition of done:** Signal bars show weighted contribution. A wallet with walletAge=100 shows "25/25" and full bar. A wallet with transactionCount=20 shows "4/20" and a short bar (20% fill).

---

### TASK 7B — Frontend: txCount Cap Indicator
**Owner:** Frontend Builder
**Phase:** 1 — Bug Fixes
**Priority:** LOW — cosmetic, no data dependency
**Depends on:** Nothing (can be done any time after Task 7)

**Full prompt for Frontend Builder:**
> In the results page, the signal bar subtitle for Transaction Count shows the raw `txCount` from the API `metadata`. When `metadata.txCount >= 1000`, display `"1,000+ transactions"` instead of `"1000 transactions"`. This communicates to users that Etherscan's free tier caps the count and the actual volume may be higher.

**Definition of done:** A wallet with txCount=1000 shows "1,000+ transactions" in the Transaction Count signal subtitle.

---

### TASK 7C — Frontend: Dynamic Rate Limit Display
**Owner:** Frontend Builder
**Phase:** 2 — Operational
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Depends on:** Nothing (reads from existing API)

**Full prompt for Frontend Builder:**
> The homepage currently has hardcoded text: "Anonymous lookups are limited to 3 per day." This value should come from the API instead. Call `GET /api/healthz` or a suitable endpoint to fetch the anonymous plan's `daily_limit` from the backend and display it dynamically. If the fetch fails, fall back to showing "limited per day" without a number. This ensures the text stays accurate when the `plan_configs` table is updated without needing a frontend redeploy.

**Definition of done:** Homepage rate limit text reflects the live `anonymous` plan's daily_limit. Changing the value in the database updates what the homepage shows automatically.

---

### TASK 7D — Backend: Bitcoin Wallet Age Fix
**Owner:** Backend Builder
**Phase:** 1 — Bug Fixes
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Depends on:** Task 3

**Full prompt for Backend Builder:**
> There is a timestamp parsing bug in the Bitcoin chain handler (`bitcoin.ts` or equivalent). When computing `walletAgedays`, the calculation returns `5` for wallets that are years old (e.g., a wallet created in 2022 returns only 5 days). Investigate the timestamp format returned by the Bitcoin API (likely milliseconds vs seconds confusion, or epoch vs block height conversion error). Fix the calculation so `walletAgedays` correctly reflects the number of days since the wallet's first transaction. Verify with a known old Bitcoin wallet address.

**Definition of done:** A Bitcoin wallet with first activity in 2020 returns a `walletAgedays` value greater than 1,000 days.

---

### ~~TASK 2B — Logo: Recreate as SVG (Replace the JPG)~~ ✅ DONE — see Completed section above
**Owner:** Frontend Builder
**Phase:** 1 — Bug Fixes (followup to Task 2)
**Priority:** HIGH — the JPG is blurry on Retina/high-DPI screens; SVG is required for crisp rendering at any size
**Depends on:** Nothing — can be done any time

**Full prompt for Frontend Builder:**
> Task 2 replaced the spiral SVG with `<img src="/logo.jpg">`. The JPG is blurry at 34px on high-DPI screens because JPGs cannot scale. The original SVG approach was architecturally correct — we need to recreate the logo as a proper SVG.
>
> **The logo design (reference the attached screenshot in docs/ or the original logo image):**
> - A double Archimedean spiral — two full loops, opening counter-clockwise from center to a clean rounded tip at the upper right
> - Mint-to-aqua gradient: inner center is `#2BD9A4`, outer tip is `#3EFFC1`
> - Subtle 3D/depth effect: the inner loop has a faint inner shadow (`filter: drop-shadow`) suggesting the spiral has slight elevation
> - Black/transparent background (the outer black circle is just the app's background, not part of the SVG)
> - The spiral's stroke is uniform width (~8% of total SVG viewBox), rounded linecaps
>
> **Steps:**
> 1. Create `public/logo.svg` — an SVG file containing the spiral path with a linearGradient or radialGradient from `#2BD9A4` to `#3EFFC1`
> 2. Update `src/components/Logo.tsx` to use `<img src="/logo.svg" width={34} height={34} alt="OTI" />` — or even better, import the SVG as a React component for full control
> 3. Update `src/lib/generateScoreCard.ts` to load `logo.svg` instead of `logo.jpg` (the `loadImage()` call is already there — just change the path)
> 4. Test at 34px (navbar), 80px (potential hero size), and in the generated score card PNG
>
> **Definition of done:** The spiral logo is crisp and sharp on a MacBook Retina screen at all sizes. No blur visible. The logo in the score card PNG matches the logo in the app navbar.

---

### TASK 8 — Frontend: Professional Results Page Redesign
**Owner:** Frontend Builder
**Phase:** 3 — Redesign
**Priority:** HIGH — MVP requirement, Ahmad's explicit request
**Depends on:** Task 7 (signal display logic must be correct first), Task 2B (logo must be SVG before the redesign ships)
**Note on ordering:** This is Phase 3 work placed here deliberately — it depends on Task 7 (Phase 1) and should run after Phase 1 backend tasks are merged. Task 9 (Admin panel, Phase 2) can run in parallel with this since they touch different parts of the codebase.

**Full prompt for Frontend Builder:**
> Redesign the scoring results page (`src/pages/Home.tsx` results section and related components). Keep: the black background, the mint green color scheme, the chain selector (do not touch it), the score gauge color system (amber/gold for low scores, mint green for high scores). Keep the "← Score Another Wallet" button.
>
> Required changes:
>
> 1. **Wallet address:** Truncate the middle — show `0xAb58...eC9B` format (first 6 + last 4 chars). Add a copy-to-clipboard icon button next to it.
>
> 2. **Score tier label:** Add a label below the score gauge based on the score value:
>    - 85–100 → "HIGHLY TRUSTED" (mint green)
>    - 65–84 → "TRUSTED" (light green)
>    - 45–64 → "CAUTION" (amber)
>    - 25–44 → "SUSPICIOUS" (orange)
>    - 0–24 → "HIGH RISK" (red)
>
> 3. **Signal section:** Add a section header "Trust Signals" above the signal bars. Each signal bar now shows `weighted/maxWeight` as the score label (from Task 7). Add visual card/panel separation between the score gauge section and the signals section.
>
> 4. **Share button:** Make it larger and more prominent — mint green border, full width or centered with min-width, not a tiny button buried at the bottom.
>
> 5. **Footer:** Add a minimal footer: "© 2026 OpenFlow Labs · openflowlabs.io"
>
> 6. **Report this wallet:** Add a small ghost link below the signals section: "⚑ Report this wallet" — it should do nothing for now (disabled or href="#") but must be present for the WOR system to connect to later.
>
> 7. **Empty space:** The large void below the share button must be eliminated. Use the footer to anchor the bottom.
>
> Keep all CSS in `src/index.css`. Do not add a new component library. Follow existing class naming conventions.

**Definition of done:** Results page looks professional on both mobile (375px) and desktop. Wallet address is truncated. Score tier label is visible. Signal bars show weighted values. Share button is prominent. Footer exists. "Report this wallet" link is present.

---

### TASK 9 — Frontend: Admin Panel UI
**Owner:** Frontend Builder
**Phase:** 2 — Operational
**Priority:** HIGH — required before bots launch (bot traffic generates signups that need managing)
**Depends on:** Task 3 (admin auth), Task 6 (updatedAt migration)

**Full prompt for Frontend Builder:**
> Add a `/admin` route to the React app. It is URL-only — no navigation link anywhere in the app. On load, it shows a simple password prompt (reads `VITE_ADMIN_SECRET` from Vercel environment variables, stored in sessionStorage after entry). Wrong password = locked view.
>
> Screens to build:
> 1. **Dashboard** — total queries today/week/month, active keys count, cache hit rate (from `GET /admin/stats`)
> 2. **API Keys** — table of all keys with plan, usage today, last used, active/suspended status. Actions: create new key (form: email, plan, daily limit), edit (change plan/limit/status), delete. (`GET /admin/keys`, `POST /admin/keys`, `PATCH /admin/keys/:id`, `DELETE /admin/keys/:id`)
> 3. **Query History** — recent wallet lookups: address, chain, score, timestamp (`GET /admin/history`)
> 4. **Cache** — a single "Flush Cache" button (`POST /admin/cache/flush`)
>
> All API calls must include the `x-admin-secret` header (read from sessionStorage). Style consistently with the existing black + mint design system. Plain HTML tables are fine — no table library required.

**Definition of done:** `/admin` route works. Password gates all screens. All 4 screens render real data from the backend. Cache flush button works.

---

### TASK 10 — Frontend: API Health Status Indicator
**Owner:** Frontend Builder
**Phase:** 2 — Operational
**Priority:** LOW — quick win, already built
**Depends on:** Nothing (the hook already exists)

**Full prompt for Frontend Builder:**
> The `src/hooks/useHealth.ts` hook already exists and pings `GET /api/healthz`. Connect it to a small status indicator in the Navbar (`src/components/Navbar.tsx`).
>
> Display: a small colored dot (6–8px circle) in the top-right of the navbar.
> - Green dot = API is responding (`status: "ok"`)
> - Red dot = API is unreachable (error state)
> - No dot / pulsing = loading
>
> Tooltip on hover: "API online" or "API offline". Keep it subtle — it should not distract from the main content.

**Definition of done:** Navbar shows a green dot when Railway API is up, red when it's down. Verified by checking the deployed frontend.

---

### TASK 11A — Restructure Vercel App: Marketing Front Door + Scoring at /score
**Owner:** Frontend Builder
**Phase:** 4 — Pre-Distribution (first priority in this phase)
**Priority:** HIGH — the current Vercel URL is impossibly long; the scoring tool has no marketing context for new visitors
**Depends on:** Task 8 (results page redesign must be done — the scoring tool must look professional before marketing traffic sees it), Task 2B (SVG logo)

**Context for the Builder:**
The current Vercel app IS the front door. We are NOT building a second site. The current app gets a new marketing homepage at `/`, and the scoring tool moves to `/score`. One Vercel project, one URL, two purposes. The Vercel URL is already `otiscore.vercel.app` ✅ — Ahmad confirmed this on July 5, 2026. The domain rename is done. The Builder does not need to change anything about the URL.

---

**Part A — Move the scoring tool to `/score`**

Move the current homepage (wallet address form + results) to the `/score` route. Update `vercel.json` carefully — the SPA rewrite rule `{"source":"/(.*)", "destination":"/index.html"}` must stay intact; do not remove or break it. Update any internal links that currently point to `/`.

---

**Part B — Build the marketing homepage at `/`**

**Brand system — everything derives from the OTI spiral logo:**
- Primary mint: `#3EFFC1` (outer/bright), `#2BD9A4` (inner/deeper)
- Background: `#0A0A0A` deep black
- Typography: Geist Sans or Inter — clean, geometric, modern
- Micro-interaction: the spiral logo rotates subtly on hover (CSS `transform: rotate()`, 2–3s ease, infinite)
- All CTAs, highlights, active states: mint only — no other accent color

**Logo:** Current `logo.jpg` is blurry — Task 2B replaces it with `logo.svg`. Task 11A should depend on Task 2B being merged first. If Task 2B is not yet done, use the JPG as a placeholder with a code comment.

**Sections to build:**

**1. Navbar**
- Left: OTI spiral logo (34px) + "OTI" wordmark in white
- Right: "Score a Wallet" button (mint outline) → `/score`; "API Docs" text link → placeholder `#`
- Mobile: hamburger with same links

**2. Hero**
- Headline: "Know Who You're Transacting With"
- Sub-headline: "OTI scores any blockchain wallet 0–100 using five on-chain trust signals. Instant. Free. API-ready."
- CTAs: "Try It Free" (mint filled → `/score`), "View API Docs" (ghost → `#`)
- Faint watermark spiral behind headline (CSS only, no JS library)
- Chain row below CTAs: small chain icons for ETH, SOL, BTC, TON, MATIC, ARB, SUI, TRX + "+7 more" badge

**3. How It Works (3 steps)**
- Step 1: Enter wallet address + select chain
- Step 2: OTI analyzes 5 on-chain behavioral signals
- Step 3: Get a 0–100 trust score with full signal breakdown
- Style: numbered cards, horizontal row on desktop, vertical stack on mobile

**4. Trust Signals (5 cards)**
- 🕐 Wallet Age (25%) — "How long this wallet has been active on-chain"
- 📊 Transaction Count (20%) — "Volume and frequency of transactions"
- 🪙 Token Holding Behavior (20%) — "Diversity and quality of tokens held"
- 🔗 Smart Contract Interactions (20%) — "Depth of DeFi and protocol engagement"
- ⏱ Transaction Timing (15%) — "Consistency and naturalness of activity patterns"

**5. Use Cases (tile grid — 3 cols desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile)**

| Tile | Sector | Body |
|---|---|---|
| 💱 | Exchanges & Gateways | Flag compromised wallets before processing withdrawals. Know the behavioral history of any address instantly. |
| 🏦 | DeFi Protocols | Risk-adjust lending and collateral requirements based on wallet trust. Score borrowers before approving credit. |
| 🖼 | NFT Marketplaces | Display trust badges next to seller listings. Filter suspicious actors before they transact. |
| 💸 | Payment Processors | Require a minimum trust score before processing. Reduce fraud without identity verification. |
| 🎮 | Web3 Gaming | Prevent fresh-wallet farming in Play-to-Earn. Verify behavioral legitimacy before distributing rewards. |
| 🗳 | DAO Governance | Weight votes by wallet trust alongside token balance. Reduce governance attacks from newly created wallets. |
| 🔐 | Custody Services | Score source wallets before crediting accounts. Flag wallets with suspicious timing patterns. |
| 📡 | Bridges & Cross-chain | Score the source wallet before allowing a bridge transaction. Stop compromised wallets at the gate. |
| 🛠 | Developer Tooling | One API call. Any chain. Embed behavioral trust scores in your product with no blockchain infrastructure required. |

**6. Get the API**
- Headline: "Free API Key. No Credit Card."
- Sub-line: "Anonymous: 3 lookups/day. Register free for higher limits."
- cURL example block (copy-pasteable)
- CTA: "Read the Docs" → `#` placeholder

**7. Find Us / Integrations**
Row of icons with labels: Telegram, Discord, Chrome Extension, Firefox Extension — all `#` placeholder links until Phase 5 channels are live.

**8. Footer**
- Left: OTI spiral logo (small) + "© 2026 OpenFlow Labs"
- Center: Score a Wallet · API Docs · GitHub (link to public frontend repo) · Privacy Policy (placeholder) · Terms (placeholder)
- Right: Social icons — Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Telegram, Discord (all `#` until accounts exist)

**Chat support — Crisp.chat:**
Add to `index.html` `<head>`:
```html
<script>window.$crisp=[];window.CRISP_WEBSITE_ID="AHMAD_PROVIDES_THIS";</script>
<script src="https://client.crisp.chat/l.js" async></script>
```
Ahmad signs up at crisp.chat (free), creates a workspace, copies the Website ID (short alphanumeric string), provides it to the Builder. If not yet provided, leave `CRISP_WEBSITE_ID=""` — widget simply won't appear until filled.

**Feedback form — Tally.so:**
Ahmad creates a form at tally.so (free): fields = Name (optional), Email (optional), Type dropdown (Bug / Feature Request / Sales / Other), Message. Ahmad provides the embed snippet. Place it in a modal triggered by "Send Feedback" in the footer. If not yet provided, use `mailto:` fallback.

---

**Definition of done:**
- `/` shows the full marketing homepage — all 8 sections present and styled
- `/score` shows the scoring tool exactly as before (no visual changes to the tool itself)
- Navbar "Score a Wallet" navigates correctly between the two views
- Crisp script is in `<head>` (even if ID is empty placeholder)
- Responsive on mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px)
- Brand system (`#0A0A0A` + `#3EFFC1` mint) is consistent throughout

---

### TASK 11B — Whitepaper Page
**Owner:** Frontend Builder
**Phase:** 4 — Pre-Distribution
**Priority:** HIGH — builds credibility with investors, enterprise partners, and serious developers
**Depends on:** Task 11A (lives inside the same Vercel project)

**Route:** `/whitepaper`

**Nav update required** (update the navbar from Task 11A):
- Desktop: `Logo | Score a Wallet | API Docs | Whitepaper | [Social icons]`
- Mobile hamburger: Score a Wallet → API Docs → Whitepaper → [Social icons]

---

**Design rules:**
- Same `#0A0A0A` black + `#3EFFC1` mint brand system as the rest of the site
- Typography: Geist Sans or Inter. Body text slightly larger than normal (17–18px), high line-height (1.8) for readability — this is a long-form document
- Section numbers are displayed in mint: `01`, `02`, `03` etc.
- Sticky table of contents sidebar on desktop (collapses to a "Jump to section" accordion on mobile)
- Faint spiral logo watermark centered behind the page header — `opacity: 0.04`, CSS only
- "Download as PDF" button in the page header — uses `window.print()` with a `@media print` stylesheet that hides the navbar, sidebar, and footer and formats the content as clean A4

---

**Full whitepaper content — copy this EXACTLY. Do not paraphrase or summarize.**

---

**PAGE HEADER**
Title: `OpenFlow Trust Infrastructure — Whitepaper`
Subtitle: `Version 1.0 · July 2026 · OpenFlow Labs`
Two buttons: `[Download PDF]` and `[Score a Wallet →]` (links to `/score`)

---

**01 — Executive Summary**

OpenFlow Trust Infrastructure (OTI) is an independent on-chain trust verification platform that enables any application, protocol, exchange, or marketplace to instantly assess the behavioral trustworthiness of any blockchain wallet address. Given a wallet address and a supported chain, OTI returns a deterministic 0–100 trust score derived from five on-chain behavioral signals — without requiring identity disclosure, KYC, or off-chain data.

OTI is the first public product developed by OpenFlow Labs, the research and engineering division of OpenFlow, a Nigerian technology company building the foundational infrastructure for the emerging attention economy. OTI is intentionally designed as an independent infrastructure business, serving external developers, protocols, DAOs, marketplaces, and enterprises, while simultaneously acting as the trust verification layer that powers OpenFlow's broader ecosystem.

---

**02 — About OpenFlow**

OpenFlow is a technology company based in Nigeria, focused on building the next generation of digital trust and attention infrastructure for Web3 and beyond. Our mission is to transform attention into a verifiable economic asset by creating systems where value is exchanged only after trust has been established.

Rather than building a single application, OpenFlow is developing an ecosystem of interoperable technologies that enable businesses, creators, advertisers, protocols, and communities to measure, verify, and monetize genuine human participation. Through infrastructure, economic design, and open standards, OpenFlow aims to become a foundational layer for the emerging attention economy.

---

**03 — About OpenFlow Labs**

OpenFlow Labs is the research and engineering division of OpenFlow. It is responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining the technologies that power the OpenFlow ecosystem.

The first product developed by OpenFlow Labs is OTI — an independent trust verification platform designed to help applications distinguish genuine users from bots, Sybil attackers, and low-quality engagement through verifiable on-chain signals.

Although OTI is the first public product, it is only the beginning. OpenFlow Labs is building a portfolio of interconnected infrastructure products that will support the OpenFlow ecosystem over the coming years, including developer tools, trust services, attention verification technologies, reputation systems, APIs, SDKs, and future infrastructure for decentralized commerce and digital participation.

OTI is intentionally designed as an independent infrastructure business. It serves external developers, protocols, DAOs, marketplaces, and enterprises while simultaneously acting as the trust layer that powers OpenFlow itself. This separation allows OTI to generate sustainable revenue from external customers, creating a cross-subsidization model that funds long-term research, infrastructure development, and future OpenFlow products without relying solely on token financing.

---

**04 — The Problem**

The internet is entering a new era where attention is one of the world's most valuable digital assets. But before attention can become valuable, it must first become trustworthy.

Today, billions of dollars are lost every year to bots, fake engagement, Sybil attacks, and unverifiable digital interactions. Existing systems measure activity — but they rarely verify authenticity.

In Web3 specifically, this problem is acute:

- Exchanges process withdrawal transactions to wallets they know nothing about
- DeFi protocols extend credit to wallets with no behavioral history
- NFT marketplaces display listings from wallets created minutes ago
- DAOs accept governance votes from freshly funded addresses
- P2P traders send funds to counterparties they cannot verify
- Launchpads are sybil-attacked by thousands of coordinated fresh wallets

Every one of these platforms faces the same fundamental question: **"Is this interaction genuine?"**

The Web3 ecosystem currently has no open, developer-accessible, chain-agnostic infrastructure to answer that question — until now.

---

**05 — How OTI Works**

OTI analyzes five on-chain behavioral signals for any wallet address on any supported chain. Each signal is scored 0–100, then weighted by its contribution to produce a final overall trust score.

| Signal | Weight | What It Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Wallet Age | 25% | How long this wallet has been active on-chain |
| Transaction Count | 20% | Volume and frequency of lifetime transactions |
| Token Holding Behavior | 20% | Diversity and quality of tokens held over time |
| Smart Contract Interactions | 20% | Depth of DeFi and protocol engagement |
| Transaction Timing Patterns | 15% | Consistency and naturalness of activity over time |

**Scoring formula:**
`Overall Score = (WalletAge × 0.25) + (TxCount × 0.20) + (TokenHolding × 0.20) + (ContractInteractions × 0.20) + (TimingPatterns × 0.15)`

**Trust tiers:**

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 85 – 100 | HIGHLY TRUSTED | Long-established, organically active wallet |
| 65 – 84 | TRUSTED | Solid behavioral history, low risk |
| 45 – 64 | CAUTION | Moderate history, proceed carefully |
| 25 – 44 | SUSPICIOUS | Thin history or unusual patterns |
| 0 – 24 | HIGH RISK | New, inactive, or behaviorally anomalous |

All scoring is performed server-side using on-chain data only. No personally identifiable information is collected or required. All results are deterministic and reproducible.

---

**06 — Supported Infrastructure**

OTI currently supports 15 blockchain networks:

**EVM chains (via Etherscan V2 API):**
Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Fantom, Linea, Scroll, zkSync, Sepolia, Holesky

**Non-EVM chains:**
Solana, TON, Bitcoin, Sui, Tron

Three additional high-volume chains — BNB Smart Chain, Base, and Optimism — are temporarily unavailable pending an infrastructure upgrade. Full coverage across all 18 networks is planned in a near-term release.

---

**07 — Use Cases**

OTI is applicable across every vertical in Web3 where trust between transacting parties matters.

**Exchanges & Gateways**
Screen withdrawal destinations before processing. Detect compromised wallets before funds leave the platform. Know the behavioral history of any recipient address in milliseconds.

**DeFi Protocols**
Risk-adjust collateral requirements and borrowing limits based on wallet trust. Score counterparties before executing credit decisions. Reduce protocol exposure to thin-history or bot-controlled wallets.

**NFT Marketplaces**
Display verifiable trust badges alongside seller listings. Filter out listings from wallets created hours before a sale. Give buyers confidence about the party on the other side of a high-value transaction.

**Payment Processors**
Require a minimum trust score before processing outbound crypto payments. Reduce fraud exposure without requiring identity documents or KYC workflows.

**Web3 Gaming**
Prevent Sybil attacks and reward farming in Play-to-Earn ecosystems. Verify wallet behavioral legitimacy before distributing tokens or prizes. Maintain fair economic environments for genuine players.

**DAO Governance**
Supplement token-based voting with trust-weighted participation. Reduce governance attacks from freshly funded wallets. Reward long-term ecosystem participants with governance influence proportional to their verifiable history.

**Custody Services**
Score incoming transfer sources before crediting accounts. Flag wallets showing anomalous timing or concentration patterns. Add a behavioral layer to existing compliance workflows.

**Cross-Chain Bridges**
Score the source wallet before allowing a bridge transaction. Stop compromised or high-risk wallets at the bridge gate rather than after funds have moved.

**Developer Tooling & Embeds**
Any Web3 product — portfolio trackers, wallet browsers, analytics dashboards, on-chain explorers — can embed OTI trust scores with a single API call. No blockchain infrastructure required on the integrator's side.

---

**08 — The Wallet Ownership Registry (WOR)**

The Wallet Ownership Registry is OTI's planned flagship trust feature — a system with no equivalent in the market.

**The problem:** When a blockchain wallet is compromised, the attacker has copied the private key. This means the original owner and the attacker both have identical signing authority. Simply connecting a wallet or signing a message does not prove you are the original owner — the attacker can do the same.

**The OTI solution — pre-registration with a passkey:**

1. A wallet owner connects their wallet to OTI before any compromise occurs
2. OTI generates a cryptographic challenge
3. The owner signs off-chain (EIP-191, zero gas cost)
4. OTI verifies the signature and records the registration
5. The owner sets a secret passkey — stored as a hash, never in plain text

If the wallet is later compromised, the original owner can submit a compromise report by connecting the wallet AND entering the pre-registered passkey. OTI verifies both — the wallet signature (which the attacker can also do) AND the passkey hash match (which the attacker cannot replicate, because they were not present for the pre-registration).

On successful verification: the wallet is immediately flagged as `compromised: true`. Its trust score drops to 0. Every API consumer using OTI is instantly aware. No admin review. No blockchain transaction. Fully automated. Real-time.

This is the only system in Web3 where a wallet owner can definitively differentiate themselves from an attacker who holds the same private key.

**09 — Distribution**

OTI reaches developers through four zero-infrastructure distribution channels, all planned for post-MVP launch:

**Telegram Bot** — Community users can query any wallet score directly in Telegram groups or DMs. Every bot reply carries OTI branding. Group mode is the primary viral lever: a single reply in a public crypto community reaches hundreds of viewers simultaneously.

**Discord Bot** — Slash command integration for Web3 Discord servers. Rich embed responses with score breakdown, signal bars, and trust tier. DeFi and NFT communities are the primary target — exactly the integrations we want to reach.

**Embeddable Widget** — A single-line JavaScript embed for any website. Site operators drop one `<script>` tag and OTI renders a live trust badge next to any wallet address. Target platforms: NFT marketplaces, OTC trading boards, blockchain analytics sites, portfolio trackers.

**Browser Extension** — A Chrome and Firefox extension that automatically detects wallet addresses on any webpage (Etherscan, OpenSea, BscScan, Blur, and beyond) and injects OTI trust badges inline. Zero effort from the user after installation.

**The conversion funnel:**
Community user sees OTI score in a bot reply → shares the score card (every share carries OTI branding) → developer discovers OTI → visits developer docs → gets a free API key → integrates into their product → product grows → becomes a paying business client → enterprise becomes a direct sales conversation.

**10 — Revenue Model**

OTI operates a tiered API access model designed to convert community users into paying business clients over time.

| Tier | Access | Limit | Price |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anonymous | No key required | 3 lookups/day | Free |
| Developer | API key | Higher daily limit | Free |
| Pro | API key | High volume | Paid (planned) |
| Enterprise | Direct contract | Unlimited + SLA | Custom pricing |

Infrastructure revenue generated by OTI API subscriptions creates a sustainable recurring income model. This cross-subsidizes OpenFlow Labs research and future OpenFlow ecosystem products, reducing dependence on token financing at early stages.

The highest-value client category is **exchanges and payment gateways** — institutions that process millions of transactions and face the greatest exposure from unverified counterparties. OTI's enterprise offering for this segment is the primary path to significant revenue.

**11 — The OpenFlow Vision**

We believe the internet is entering a new era where attention becomes one of the world's most valuable digital assets. However, before attention can become valuable, it must first become trustworthy.

OTI is the foundation of a larger vision: **the OpenFlow Attention Economy**.

The OpenFlow Attention Economy introduces a new economic model where verified attention becomes an asset that can be measured, priced, exchanged, and rewarded across multiple ecosystems. Rather than treating attention as disposable advertising inventory, OpenFlow transforms genuine participation into economic value through transparent verification and sustainable economic design.

OpenFlow combines two complementary models to support this vision:

**Infrastructure Revenue** — generated by products such as OTI, creating sustainable recurring income through enterprise APIs, verification services, and developer tools. This funds operations and research independently of token markets.

**The OpenFlow Economy** — powered by the FLOW ecosystem, which aligns participants through decentralized incentives and ecosystem growth.

As adoption grows, OpenFlow plans to introduce both private and public token offerings to expand ecosystem participation and accelerate global development. Those fundraising events are intended to strengthen an already functioning ecosystem — not finance an idea. Our objective is to demonstrate real products, real users, and sustainable infrastructure before inviting broader community ownership.

Ultimately, our ambition is not simply to build another Web3 platform, but to establish the global infrastructure where trust enables value, and verified attention powers a new digital economy.

**Definition of done:**
- `/whitepaper` route is live, all 14 sections present with exact content above
- Sticky TOC sidebar works on desktop; collapses on mobile
- "Download PDF" button uses `window.print()` with clean `@media print` stylesheet
- Navbar updated across the whole site to include "Whitepaper" as the last item before social icons
- Faint spiral watermark in page header
- Fully responsive on mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px)

### TASK 11 — Developer Docs Site
**Owner:** Frontend Builder
**Phase:** 4 — Pre-Distribution
**Priority:** HIGH — hard dependency before any bot or widget launches
**Depends on:** Task 5 (weighted signal response must be finalized before documenting the API shape)

**Full prompt for Frontend Builder:**
> Set up a Docusaurus documentation site for OTI. Deploy it to Vercel on the same account as the frontend (Vercel auto-detects Docusaurus — zero config needed).
>
> ```bash
> npx create-docusaurus@latest oti-docs classic
> ```
>
> The docs must cover (in order of priority):
> 1. **Getting Started (CRITICAL)** — What OTI is in one paragraph. How to get a free API key. One copy-paste cURL example that works immediately. Link to API Reference.
> 2. **API Reference (CRITICAL)** — Every endpoint, every parameter, every response field (use the new weighted signal shape from Task 5), all error codes.
> 3. **Score Explanation (CRITICAL)** — What 0–100 means. What each signal measures. The 5 tier labels (HIGHLY TRUSTED / TRUSTED / CAUTION / SUSPICIOUS / HIGH RISK). How weighted contributions work.
> 4. **Supported Chains (IMPORTANT)** — All 15 chains, chain IDs, limitations (BSC/Base/Optimism = 503, txCount cap at 1,000).
> 5. **Rate Limits & Plans (IMPORTANT)** — Anonymous = 3/day, Free plan limits, how to upgrade.
> 6. **Code Examples (IMPORTANT)** — JavaScript (fetch), Python (requests), cURL — all copy-paste working examples.
>
> Style: keep OTI branding. The site footer should say "OpenFlow Labs · openflowlabs.io".

**Definition of done:** Docusaurus site is live on Vercel. Getting Started page works — a developer can read it and make their first API call within 5 minutes.
