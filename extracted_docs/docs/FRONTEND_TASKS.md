# OTI — Frontend Builder Task List
> Last updated: July 10, 2026 (session 8 — full rewrite. Bug fixes, cleanup, and polish work moved out to `FIXES.md` — including the former Task 11E, now FF17 there. This file now only lists genuine new-build tasks.) | Maintained by: Development Manager
> **This file contains your tasks only. Read BUILDER_ONBOARDING.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and DECISIONS.md before starting anything here. Read `FIXES.md` too — FF17 (AI-native tell cleanup) is your likely next item, pending Ahmad's priority call.**
> **`DECISIONS.md` documents why certain things exist the way they do — read it before touching any chain logic, scoring display, or address validation code. You never update DECISIONS.md yourself.**
> Build in the exact order listed. Some tasks have hard dependencies — do not start them until the dependency is confirmed merged and deployed.
>
> **⚠️ This is YOUR copy of this file, in YOUR own account/repo.** The Manager's copy of this file is separate and does not sync with yours. Only mark a task done here, or add a new task here, when the Manager explicitly tells you to.

## Where You Stand Right Now

**As of July 14, 2026 — you have NO active task.** All build tasks and all frontend fixes (FF1–FF23) are complete. Your next confirmed item is **BF12** frontend side if applicable — but wait for the Manager to send a prompt. Do not start anything on your own.

## ✅ Your Completed Tasks (genuine new-build work)

### TASK 8 — Professional Results Page Redesign ✅
**Completed:** July 7, 2026. Full visual rebuild of the wallet score results page: score panel in its own bordered card with a chain-color ring gauge, score tier label (HIGHLY TRUSTED → HIGH RISK), a separate "Trust Signals" card with weighted signal bars, truncated wallet address with copy button, native-share-sheet Share button, 3× PNG "Save as Image" export, "⚑ Report this wallet" placeholder ghost link (for WOR, Phase 2), and a footer. This task also established the OTI color system below — every later task must use it.

### TASK 8B — Professional Wallet Input Page Redesign ✅
**Completed:** July 8, 2026. Matching redesign of the landing/input screen: logo sizing and position, gradient wordmark, tagline, mint-glow form card, styled rate-limit badge, "Try an example →" link, WOR ghost links, footer, faint watermark, plus a polish round fixing zkSync/Linea icon visibility, chain icon/dropdown sizing, and mobile vertical spacing.

### TASK 9 — Admin Panel UI ✅
**Completed:** July 7, 2026. Built the `/admin` route (URL-only, no public nav link, per Ahmad's decision): password gate, Dashboard, API Keys (create/list/edit/delete, reveal-once creation modal), Query History, Cache, and Plan Configs tabs. All calls authenticate with `x-admin-secret` from sessionStorage.

### TASK 11A — Restructure Vercel App: Marketing Front Door + Scoring at /score ✅
**Completed:** July 8, 2026. Moved the scoring tool intact to `/score` and built a full marketing homepage at `/`: navbar, hero with chain row, How It Works (3 steps), Trust Signals (5 cards), Use Cases (9-tile grid), Get the API (cURL example), Find Us/Integrations row, footer with social links. Crisp.chat live-chat widget embedded in `<head>` (site ID left blank until Ahmad provides it). Brand consistency with `/score` verified via cache-busted screenshot and JS bundle inspection by the Manager, and directly by Ahmad.

### TASK 11B — Whitepaper Page ✅
**Completed:** July 8, 2026 (build), fixes verified July 8–9, 2026. Built `/whitepaper`: full section-by-section technical/business document, sticky TOC sidebar on desktop (accordion on mobile), mint section numbers, print-to-PDF via `window.print()`, shared navbar/footer/color system with the homepage. Three post-launch rendering fixes (body text color, mobile horizontal scroll, Roadmap section removal) are logged in `FIXES.md` FF16.

### TASK 11 — Developer Docs Site ✅
**Completed:** July 9, 2026. Docusaurus site (`oti-docs/`) covering Getting Started, API Reference, Score Explanation, Supported Chains, Rate Limits, and JS/Python/cURL examples, plus an OG social-share image and a live "Try It Live" widget. Deployed as its own Vercel project (pnpm-based build — oti-docs uses pnpm; the main frontend app uses npm — do not mix them) and proxied onto the main site at `/docs/` via `vercel.json` rewrites. Confirmed fully live via curl on `/docs`, `/docs/`, and `/docs/api-reference`. One open follow-up: `FIXES.md` BF11/BF-style item — re-verify "Try It Live" hits the real Railway backend post-redeploy (tracked as BF11 in `FIXES.md`, owned by whichever Builder picks it up next — currently unassigned).

## 🎨 OTI Color System (Locked — July 7, 2026)

> This palette replaced the old flat black + mint system. Every future task must use these exact values. Do not revert to pure black (`#000000`) or the old surface colors.

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Background | `#05080f` | Page background — deep blue-black |
| Surface | `#0b0f1a` | Card backgrounds, panels |
| Surface-2 | `#0f1520` | Inner elements, signal bar tracks |
| Borders | `#1c2535` | All card/panel borders |
| Body text | `#e8f4ff` | Main readable text — slight blue tint |
| Dimmed text | `#7a8fa8` | Metadata, labels, secondary text |
| Mint (primary) | `#00e5a0` | CTAs, highlights, active states, mint accents |
| Mint (gradient end) | `#3EFFC1` | Gradient highlights |

**Chain brand colors (ring gauge + panel tint):** Ethereum `#627EEA` · Bitcoin `#F7931A` · Solana `#9945FF` · BNB `#F3BA2F` · (all 15 chains have their exact brand hex in the codebase — check there before inventing a new one).

**Special effects (do not remove):**
- Navbar: `backdrop-filter: blur(14px)` frosted glass
- Submit button: green glow on hover `box-shadow: 0 0 24px rgba(0,229,160,0.40)`
- Score panel: border + background tint shifts toward the selected chain's brand color via `color-mix()`
- Signal bars: 5px height, soft color glow on fill
- All `color-mix()` declarations have plain-value fallbacks above them for older browsers

### TASK 17 — WOR UI — Phase 2 ✅
/register (3-step: address check → MetaMask sign → passkey set) and /report (3-step: status check → sign + passkey → confirm dialog). "⚑ Report this wallet" link activated on results page. Admin WOR tab (Registry, Compromised, Manual Override). Verified live by Ahmad July 14, 2026. Follow-up polish tracked as FF24.

## 🔴 Your Task Queue

### TASK 18 — Services Hub Page (`/services`) 🔴 ACTIVE — July 15, 2026
New page at `/services`. Full prompt in the Manager's task message. Running alongside FF25/FF26/FF27 in FIXES.md — do all four together.

---

## ⏳ Future Tasks (Not Yet Active — Manager Will Assign When Ready)

- **Phase 5:** Firefox browser extension (then Chrome) — separate repo, content script that detects wallet addresses on Etherscan/OpenSea and injects OTI score badges
- **Phase 2:** Wallet Ownership Registry (WOR) UI — registration flow, compromise report flow, passkey integration
- **Phase 3:** Self-serve developer portal — sign up, get API key, choose plan

## Keeping This File Updated

You never update either file on your own initiative. Every update — whether marking a task done or adding a new one — happens only when the Manager explicitly tells you to.

**When you complete a task:**
1. Notify the Manager — do not mark anything done yourself
2. Wait for the Manager to review and confirm your work
3. Only when the Manager explicitly tells you to mark it done:
   - Move it to the ✅ Completed Tasks section in this file
   - Mark it ✅ in `TASKS.md` as well (or in `FIXES.md`, if it's a fix, not a task)
4. All your files must always match the Manager's

**When the Manager assigns you a new task:**
1. The Manager will explicitly tell you to add the new task to your file
2. Only then: add it to the bottom of your Queue section in this file AND add it to `TASKS.md`
3. Read it fully before starting — every task has a "Why" and a "Definition of done"
4. Do not start a task that has a ⚠️ dependency warning until the Manager confirms it is cleared

**General rules:**
- Never touch Git, never push, never open a PR — Ahmad handles all of that himself
- Never touch `vercel.json` — ever
- Never manually edit `src/api/schema.gen.ts` — run `npm run codegen` instead
- Main app uses **npm**. Docs site (`oti-docs/`) uses **pnpm**. Never mix them.
- Ahmad loves the chain selector — do not touch it
- All CSS goes in `src/index.css` — no new component libraries
- Test on mobile (375px) — most users are on mobile
- If a task is blocked, tell the Manager immediately — do not sit on a blocker
- Never update any file without the Manager's explicit instruction
